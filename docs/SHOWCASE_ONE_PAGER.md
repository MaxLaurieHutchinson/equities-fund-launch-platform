## Equities Fund Launch Platform (C#)

A modular platform that demonstrates how a new algorithmic equities sub-fund can be launched and operated from a technology perspective.

## What It Shows

- End-to-end ownership across strategy, risk, execution, and observability.
- Deterministic, auditable runtime outputs suitable for technical review.
- Design choices aligned with front-office reality: speed, control, transparency.

## Core Capabilities

- strategy onboarding and orchestration
- policy-driven risk gate and overrides
- execution intent generation and route selection
- incident simulation + replay workflow
- TCA feedback loop with guardrail-aware recommendations
- multi-agent arena for negotiated capital allocation
- control-plane health/anomaly monitoring
- public-safe showcase packaging (`artifacts/showcase/public`)

## Why It Matters

This project moves beyond isolated labs into a cohesive system that reflects real quant-fund technology leadership responsibilities.
